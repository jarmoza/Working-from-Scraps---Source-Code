Crosse's experiment caused controversy and he was accused by some of being in \"league with the devil\". The experiment has never been successfully repeated, and the article offers Faraday's theory that the insects \"had been fossilized in the stone and were revived by the current in the solution. More likely still is the theory that the creatures hatched out of eggs by the electric force that acted on them like an incubator\". The clipping also includes two wood-block prints, one showing an array of scientific test tubes in front of a smoking volcano and one a decorative drawing of a crystal. Morgan has annotated this clipping with the source (Enquiry), but has also noted \"see R.T. Gould, Oddities, 1944\" for further reading. This page also features three clippings concerning the Loch Ness Monster. The first is titled \"Nessy's Pa Mort\", and reads \"John C. MacKay, the reporter who first sent out stories about the Loch Ness Monster, died at Inverness, 7-17-52 old style. He was 84. Nessy survives however. She was 'seen' in May.\" The second clipping is untitled and reads \"On her first visit to Scotland, Gypsy Rose Lee took a quick trip up to Loch Ness. She wanted the monster to see her.\" The final clipping is titled \"Nessie is on Show Again\", and reports that \"two appearances by the Loch Ness monster on successive evenings were reported\". The first sighting was by \"Robert Burrell, a fishing ghillie; Roderick MacLean, a hotel employee; and a London chauffeur who was driving American visitors on a Scottish tour.\" The second sighting was by \"an Army officer from Fort George,\" who claimed to have watched the monster for \"almost 20 minutes\".

The second is a still life, which includes grapes, a grape branch, peaches, flowers, a small brown mouse, and brown, white, and orange butterfly, captioned as \"Jan Van Huysum. 1682-1749.\" Between these two reproductions, Morgan has included two small text-based clippings. The first reads \"The Moscow Literary Gazette has condemned Russian parents who give their children such names as 'Electrification' and 'Cracking Combine.' One boy was recently named 'Detector,' the writer complained.\" The second is a hand-written clipping that reads, \"Comme je demandais \u00e0 Genet pourquoi il refusait de conna\u00eetre Gide, il me r\u00e9pondit : 'On est accus\u00e9 ou juge. Je n'aime pas les juges qui se penchent amouseusement vers les accus\u00e9s.' J.C.\" To the right of these clippings, Morgan has included a long article discussing Einstein's \"new cosmic theory, 'a generalised theory of gravitation,' which attempts to interpret in one synthesis the known physical phenomena of the material world.\" The article states that the announcement of the theory was planned \"to coincide with the opening . . . of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\" It also says that Einstein himself has acknowledged that he has \"not yet found a practical way . . . to confront the results of the theory with experimental evidence.\" The article then considers how long it took for Einstein's theories of relativity and general relativity to find proof and discusses how this new theory seeks to address \"the resistance of electro-magnetism to explain itself in terms of the theory that successfully interpreted time, space, matter, energy, gravitation, and inertia.\" No comment was given by those at the American Association meeting, and the publication date for the full text is said to be February.

The article concludes by stating that \"attention may be drawn to the obvious difficulties of obtaining reliable information on longevity in all but captive and domesticated animals.

On the left (southern) rim is Kilimanjaro's highest point, Kaiser Wilhelm Spitze (19,565 ft.). In the background, circled by clouds, can be seen the summit of Mount Meru (14,979 ft.), 45 miles to the west of Kilimanjaro.

On the top photograph of Kibo from E.N-E, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of an older man's face into the clouds above the mountain. The article segment discusses Rev. Johannes Rebmann's first encounter with Kilimanjaro in 1848, including his surprise at seeing snow in Africa and his assertion that the presence of the snow and cold explained the dominant belief that evil spirits blocked access to the mountain. The segment concludes by stating that \"Kilimanjaro consists of two main peaks joined by a long saddle at an altitude of about 16,000 ft. The secondary peak, Mawenzi (17546 ft.), is an extinct volcano and geologically very much older and, consequently, more weathered than Kibo.

Robson.)\", and \"An eroded ice-cliff - an example of 'nieve penitente,' caused by vertical weathering. Such fantastic shapes are common on Kilimanjaro. (Photograph: E. Robson.)\". The article excerpt discusses the initial publications of Rebmann's reports on Kilimanjaro, and particularly the report, surprising at the time, \"that mountains covered with perpetual snow could be found just under the Equator\". The article then discusses 1943 and 1945 expeditions to Kilimanjaro by Lieut.-Commander P. C. Spink \"to examine the curious structure of glaciers under the influence of an equatorial sun. Such glaciers present an interesting study for the glaciologist, since, unlike those of high latitudes, they are subjected to vertical sun-rays, resulting in a vertical type of weathering, with curious and almost freak effects. 'Nieve penitente' formations are common, a good example being seen in one of the photographs above, and another fascinating effect is the lamination of snow surfaces. In places, the latter assumes the form of thin sheets of snow, like the leaves of a book, about six inches apart, up to two feet high, and extremely fragile. It is thought that this effect is caused by the combined action of sun and wind upon the frozen mass of snowfield, the crystalline parts remaining erect in this strange fashion. The steady shrinkage of the ice area of Kibo is manifest on the outer glaciers. Ablation of the smooth, firm surfaces takes the form of huge horizontal and parallel ice-steps, and this erosion can be seen clearly.\" Other clippings on this page include a black and white photograph of a bulldog standing on its hind legs and looking over a wire fence, a black and white photograph of what appears to be a pillar or column, a black and white photograph of a man in uniform on a large ship taken from below the level of the ship's deck, a black and white photograph of a curved brick wall, a black and white photograph of a man lying on his stomach while propped up on his elbows and wearing cowboy boots, a cowboy hat, and a plaid shirt, a black and white photograph of a man lying on his back with his eyes closed, whom appears to have a boxing glove on one hand and so may have been knocked out, a black and white photograph of a waterfall, and a black and white photograph of two young men in an industrial indoor space leaning over a fire.

F. Barber. The article opens with an anecdote about Robert Louis Stevenson's dad, Thomas Stevenson, setting him to \"measure the height of waves on the sea and the strength of the wind, to check a simple rule about the growth of waves which the elder Stevenson had propounded\". The rest of the article goes on to discuss the study of waves by engineers and devised schemes to, for example, obtain \"power from breaking waves by guiding them to throw water into a lagoon some 10 or 15 ft. above sea-level, electrical power being generated where the enclosed water runs off through turbines\". The article continues by discussing the increasingly scientific study of waves, measuring, for example, the great distances they can travel once generated by a storm. Research by the Admiralty focuses on \"being able to forecast those times when the surf will be low enough to permit sea-going ships to be laden by small shore craft\". The article states that \"At the Admiralty wave-recording station in Perranporth, Cornwall, are various instruments which distinguish swell by its characteristic long time-interval\", which can act as a warning for incoming danger. The article also states that \"the most satisfactory prediction of waves and swell is based on a detailed knowledge of the storms that produce it. The wind systems over all the North Atlantic Ocean are summarised in charts issued every six hours by the Air Ministry and by the Admiralty, showing the 'fronts' or boundaries of the circulating masses of cold and warmer air which make up storms, contours of the areas of high and low barometric pressure and a large number of measurements of wind. Ships of all nationalities make these observations while on voyage and report them by wireless\". There are also special ships at six positions in the North Atlantic used for monitoring weather and waves. The article reports that \"It is curious to note that fish by their behaviour can indicate the presence of a distant storm even before the ground swell reaches them\", demonstrated, for example, by the fact that cod and haddock will avoid certain eating or resting grounds that prove to be later affected by a storm. The article includes a black and white photograph of waves breaking on a beach, captioned as \"Swell from a mid-Atlantic storm arriving at Perranporth, North Cornwall, where the Admiralty wave-recording station has various instruments which distinguish swell by its characteristic long time-interval\". An abstract for the article is also included below the picture, which reads \"In the 'World of Science' article on this page, Mr. N. F. Barber discusses some of the aspects of research into the movement of waves and the effect of storms on the surf which beats upon beaches some thousands of miles from the centre of the disturbance. Perranporth, whose flat and sandy beach open to the Atlantic swell has made it famous for its surf-riding, also provides the site for an Admiralty wave-recording station\". Also included on this page is a colour photograph of a colourful bird, which Morgan has annotated as a hoopoe, a black and white photograph of a man in a handstand with his legs stretched out behind him parallel with the floor, captioned as \"The Original Peter, a popular variety and television act\", a short clipping that reads \"'Ninety Milwaukee tenants, all wearing masks, appeal for rent controls before a State legislature committee' in Madison, May 15.

The article continues, stating that man is a \"paranoid Prometheus whose cunning and strength have been exclusively devoted to releasing the forces of his own damnation\". The article considers presentations across a range of subjects taken up at the meeting. The article's first heading is \"Mastery of Nature\", which discusses a trend away from \"enchantment with the mechanical world\" into \"skepticism about the world of super-explosive energy\" through a consideration of issues such as \"Mesons, alpha particles, heavy water, isotopes, genes and hormones, [and] the control of communicable diseases\". Other headings include \"Without Boundaries\", which discusses both the unifying force of science, and the fact that humans are surpassing their resources for the fulfillment of basic needs, \"'Menaces' to Survival\", which discusses \"two 'menaces' to mankind's survival\" as being \"the modern conquest of disease and the plans to redistribute industrial populations without regard to their population potential\". Also critiqued here is home industry and the gap between \"useful findings and their general application\" in the building of homes. Another heading, \"Atomic Space Ships\", discusses \"space ships propelled outside the pull of gravity by atomic energy\", although the problem of waste heat currently impedes that plan, and warnings from the United States Atomic Energy Commission that \"if atomic scientists continue to be made the butts of 'un-American smears' the United States might find itself without enough of them to keep its lead in essential atomic research and in the further refinement and stockpiling of the atom bomb\". Finally, under the heading \"Politicians' Maturity\", Dr. Carl Sulzberger's critique of diplomats in his address to the UN is reported, which took place on the same day as the Association's meeting. He is quoted as describing the diplomats as \"a group of children, aged about three and four, trying to break one another's toys or squabbling to get closer to the ice-cream dish without a thought of one another\". This section concludes with a quotation from Freud, which reads \"The internal-combustion engine utilises, I believe, about 19 per cent of its available energy. The human being utilises rather less, if by energy is understood the ability to do all the work he is healthily able, to love and be loved effectively, and to work amiably and creatively with his fellow-men\".

Here we show remarkable examples recently secured at the White Sands rocket base headquarters in New Mexico. At the top and bottom of the page we show two mosaics - panoramas made by joining a series of exposures - the upper taken from a German V 2 rocket at a height of approximately 60 miles; and the lower from a U.S. Aerobee rocket at 57 miles. The large picture in the center is an enlarged section from the upper mosaic and gives some idea of the detail which can be secured. On comparison with the atlas, the upper mosaic is found to reveal the panorama (looking westward) of an arc which starts in Mexico, passes through Lordsburg and Albuquerque, and ends in the Sangre de Cristo Mts. The lower, a more vertical view, lies a little to the east and interestingly shows the launching site of the rocket and also that of the first atomic tests\". The photographs' captions read: \"The curve of the earth revealed in a mosaic of photographs taken from a V 2 rocket 60 miles up\", \"A detail from the Global Air Survey photograph above. This enlarged section is taken from round about the Figure (1), showing the Northern parts of Mexico and looking westward towards the Gulf of California\", and \"From Mexico to Wyoming in a single view: An aerial mosaic from an Aerobee rocket 57 miles up\". Onto the second image, which is the enlarged photograph from the first mosaic, Morgan has pasted in two text-based clippings. The first reads \"'These religionists who believe in the second coming of the Lord - which direction is the Lord coming from? If the earth is a ball the heavens would be wrapped around the ball, and every direction would be up. And again, how could the Lord and his crowd hop on with the earth going hell west and crooked through space?'\" The second clipping reads \"Although they have seen rocket photographs showing the curve in the earth's surface, members of the 'Christian Catholic Church' sect at Zion, Illinois, are still convinced that the earth is flat. The photographs taken from an altitude of 57 miles over the White Sands proving grounds in New Mexico this week, were waved aside by the overseer of the sect, Mr. M. J. Mintern, when a reporter produced them. 'When you have something really worth while in the way of proof that the earth is spherical let me know,' he said.\" Along the top of the page, Morgan has included a few small clippings, including a black and white photograph of a male dancer taken from above, a black and white photograph of a lemur, a colour reproduction of Loraine Smith's engraving \"Loss of the Chaplain\", and a separate clipping explaining the context of \"Loss of the Chaplain\". The explanatory clipping reads \"Loss of the Chaplain. The greatest misfortune that can happen to a Club of Fox-hunters, respectfully dedicated to the Humane Society. Painted by C. Loraine Smith.

(Bottom, right) Detail of the Island of Paradise, which appear on the circumference in the top centre. (Dimensions approx. 64 in. high by 56 in. wide.).

The article also states that the map was \"cleaned and repaired . . . under the supervision of the Map Room of the British Museum\". The map is described as being \"centered on Jerusalem, with the east at the head, where Paradise is shown as an island. The centre of the lower half is occupied by the Mediterranean, which runs to the left of the Black Sea. The British Isles, on the circumference in the lower left corner, in part embody twelfth-century names. The map contains numerous drawings of men and creatures, often mythical, which figure in the works of the Latin cosmographers, and details have been added from Biblical history. The basis is probably a Roman map of the fourth, or perhaps the first, century.\" The map is also compared in the article to the \"Ebstorf map of c. 1235, which was preserved at Hanover before the war. Portions of this map had been lost, and its present location is not known\". Other clippings on this page include a sepia-toned photograph of a group of people sitting outside in a mountainous landscape, a cropped colour photograph of an American football player, and a black and white headshot photograph of Marlene Dietrich, which Morgan has annotated with the initials \"M.D.\". This page also includes a short clipping titled \"Hush!!! Hush!!!\", which reads \"Afternoon of May 15, two Chatsworth, Calif., school boys were walking home when a 'burst of machine gun slugs' began pelting the road and fields all around them. They heard no explosion and saw no plane, but they picked up some of the slugs - such as are used in nose-guns of jet fighters. 'A joint investigation by the police, Air Force and Navy failed today to find the source - etc.' O-oh, say, can you see? By the dawn's early light!\". Morgan has annotated this clipping with \"FSM 34\" in the upper left corner and \"1951\" in the lower right corner.

Next to this clipping, Morgan has included a brief write-up contextualizing the print, which reads \"The Battle between Cribb and Molineaux. After Rowlandson. Published 1811. In this famous fight at Thistleton Gap, Tom Cribb (an early champion) vanquished the negro Molineaux for the second time. Prize-fighting was at this time at the height of its popularity, and although boxing-gloves were used for sparring practice and for teaching purposes, all important contests were decided with the bare fists.

The uncaptioned photo shows two small worms on a rocky surface. Onto the large photograph of the glowworm threads, Morgan has pasted in two clippings: a black and white photograph of a carved head and a black and white photograph of a young man in a suit, positioned so that the man in the suit appears to be looking up at the carved head. The article, titled \"Glowworms: Their bright taillights help snare insects in dark New Zealand cave\", describes the Waitomo Cave as \"strange and lovely\". The write-up describes the ways in which the glow from the worms attracts moths and midges to them, which are then entangled in thread and swallowed by the glowworms. The write-up continues, stating that \"After several months of glowing and eating, the worm becomes a chrysalis and later turns into a fly\". The large clipping has been folded over along its right-hand edge so that it will fit into the scrapbook.

Morgan has annotated the clipping with a reference to other scrapbook pages, stating \"cf 716, 1391\". Also included on this page is a clipping containing two black and white reproductions of paintings. The first is captioned as \"Above, 'The Singer', by Keith Vaughan, from the exhibition at the Redfern Gallery\", and the second captioned as \"Below, 'Seated Woman', a hitherto unknown drawing by Rembrandt recently acquired by and on exhibition in the British Museum\". In between these two reproductions and below the captions, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of a skeleton in a grave. Other clippings on this page include a black and white reproduction of Bronzino's \"Portrait of a Young Man\", which Morgan has annotated with the artist's name and which overlaps on top of the reproduction of 'The Singer', a short text-based clipping that reads \"What was the meaning of the expression 'janitorial services' in a Scottish Education Department circular? asks Mr J. Hoy (Leith-Lab.) in the Commons last night. Secretary of State James Stuart, replying, said they were 'services undertaken by those appointed to carry out functions or duties for which school janitors are responsible'\", a handwritten clipping quoted F.

Similarly, after the Charleston hurricane in September 1752 trees which were stripped of their leaves blossomed again + bore fruit in the late autumn\", which also overlaps on the Vaughan reproduction, and  a text-based clipping that references the writer's dog and its observed ability to distinguish between aeroplanes and helicopters, the latter of which it \"violently protests against\". The clipping then discusses the cat of Neville Duke, test pilot, who shows \"the ability to detect the approach of those bangs which occur when aircraft exceed the speed of sound\" well before the sound is audible to humans. The clipping concludes by stating that \"The phenomenon is well known, I gather, to those who live near the testing areas of supersonic aircraft, and there have been many stories, hotly debated, of broken windows and displaced roof-tiles, but no humans have claimed to be able to sense the approach of what has been called this 'accumulated bubble of sound' or of the slight shock-wave which accompanies it. Duke has no theory to explain the cat's prescience\". The page also includes a large clipping that features a black and white photograph of a stone carving, captioned as \"An animal in grey stone, about 4 feet high, used now as a Christian tombstone on the site excavated, but dating back to between 1500 and 1000 B.C.\" Below the photograph is an article, which Morgan has annotated as being from 29 December 1948, which discusses a recent English excavation expedition \"at a prehistoric site near Rezaiyyeh, in Azerbaijan\". The article reports that \"Thanks to kindly assistance and co-operation on the part of the Iranian authorities, it was possible to obtain an excellently stratified sequence of material, mainly pottery, dating from the beginning of the third millennium until about 1,000 B.C\". The dig extended to 44 feet down, and still did not \"reach the original surface of the plain on which the site stood\". The article then describes the various strata that were uncovered: a first stratum of \"red polished ware\" dating from 3,000 BC; a second stratum of grey polished ware, \"some of it being ornamented with elaborate motifs, include the spiral, modelled in relief\", as well as \"Models of long-horned cattle and gaming pieces\"; a third stratum of \"elaborate black polished pots with grey rims and decoration of a previously unknown variety, consisting of a horizontal zone of shallow depressions, circular in shape and alternating with diagonal incisions\", as well as \"pottery of the Susa II type (about 2000 B.C in Southern Iran)\", some tombs \"equipped with pottery, bronzes, necklaces, and beautiful obsidian arrow-heads\", and a \"smithy with iron and lead ores\"; a fourth stratum of \"undecorated but polished red or black ware, with 'beak-spouted' jars of a kind of tea-pot shape\" and a cemetery; and a fifth stratum from \"the close of the second millennium\" with material \"already well known to archaeologists from the explorations of Sir Aurel Stein 14 years ago in the same general area\". The article concludes by stating that \"The finds, which the Iranian Government most kindly allowed to be kept together (an act facilitating to the highest degree the study of ancient Azerbaijan), will, it is hoped, be on exhibition at Oxford early next year\"."}, {"people_ids": ["689", "690", "691", "41", "28"], "sources_ids": ["140", "454", "455", "456"], "people_roles": {"28": ["Depicted in clipping"], "690": ["Photographer"], "691": ["Photographer"], "689": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "41": ["Depicted in clipping"]}, "clippings": 14, "suffix": "", "places_ids": ["599", "600", "113"], "notes": "", "number": "1522", "orig_material": "N", "clippings_w_metadata": 3, "book_id": "3", "keywords": ["Collage", "Rafflesia Arnoldi", "Flowers", "Jungle", "Men", "Earthworm", "Wrestling", "Sports", "Art", "Carving", "Handstand", "Christmas", "Nativity", "Cherub", "Religion", "Advertisement", "Socks", "Clothing", "Door"], "stats": {"people_nationalities": {"Galilean Jewish": 2, "English": 1, "Italian": 1}, "continent_counts": {"North America": 2, "Europe": 1}, "people_genders": {"Male": 4, "Female": 1}, "source_dates": {}, "sources_rights_holders": {}, "sources_places": {"US": 1}, "people_titles": {"National Geographic correspondent, photographer": 1, "Catholic saint": 1, "painter": 1, "entomologist, photographer": 1}, "place_counts_dict": {}, "people_dates_lived": {}}, "foldout": "N", "id": "142", "orientations": ["portrait"], "desc": "This page features a colour reproduction of Mantegna's The Adoration of the Shepherds, captioned as \"Christmas in a Fifteenth-Century Masterpiece.

Below the image is a write-up, which states that the caterpillar will become \"the beautiful Tiger Swallowtail butterfly, one of the commonest species of North America\". The caterpillar is described as being \"2 ins. long when fully grown, and greenish-yellow in colour. The 'eye' spots are yellow, edged with black, and the 'pupil' is blue with a black border. The true eyes are much lower down on the head, near the mouth-parts\". The caterpillar also has \"a pair of bright-coloured fleshy 'horns' which can be projected from a slit in the dorsal wall of the prothorax. This slit can be seen in our photograph running across the base of the large upper 'lip'. The 'horns' are like the fingers of a glove, and are turned inside-out when in the body - the inner surface becoming the outer when the horns are projected. This outer surface gives off a highly disagreeable odour which has led to these caterpillars being called 'the polecats of the Insect World.'\" The caterpillar is said to eat \"birch, poplar, wild-cherry, fruit trees and many other trees and shrubs.\" Pasted onto the bottom of the photograph, but above the caption, Morgan has included a smaller photograph of the same caterpillar, taken from the side, and beside this, in the lower right corner of the larger caterpillar clipping, he has pasted a colour photograph of a fish's head with an open mouth, seemingly chasing the smaller side-view photograph of the caterpillar. Pasted above the smaller caterpillar image, Morgan has also included an article from 1952 discussing the use of supersonic sound in \"a variety of creatures, from shrimps to whales\". The article cites the research of Mr. W. N. Kellogg and Mr. Robert Kohler who \"conducted a series of experiments on this subject in a large tank at the Oceanographic Department of the University of Florida at Tallahassee. The tests were on bottle-nosed dolphins whose sound range rises from a low growl and groan-like sound to a shrill whistle which may rise to a frequency of several thousand cycles per second. These dolphins have highly developed acoustic receptor organs although they seem to be deficient in smell sense, which is surprising in creatures which obtain all their food under water.\" The experiments \"produced underwater sounds from an oscillator with a range of 20 to 200,000 cycles per second. The stimuli were in short bursts of about two or three seconds. High tones had the immediate effect of increasing the swimming speed of the creatures. Low tones disturbed them even more; they broke up their swimming formations, leapt out of the water, and at times seemed to charge the sound machine. From these experiments it is inferred that dolphins possess an upper limit of hearing much higher than that of man, perhaps reaching an upper threshold of 80,000 cycles per second\". The research also speculates that \"The low frequencies may represent dangerous sounds such as ships' propellers or the noise of surf beating on the shore\". Other clippings on this page include a black and white photograph of a man kneeling down and playing a stringed instrument, a black and white photograph that looks like it might be a window shutter, a black and white photograph of a man in dark underwear posing in a seated position with what looks like a fishing net behind him, a black and white reproduction of drawing captioned as \"No.42 - Tengus troubling the Sleep of Sagami (or Takatoki?).

The eagle clipping states that \"Not many golden eagles die a natural death, but I believe that, under favourable circumstances, their life exceeds that of a human being. We, or our successors, may in time learn more of this if the young golden eagles which are now being ringed in the eyrie are recovered in later years. When I was looking through an old newspaper-cutting book belonging to a friend, I came across a contemporary account of the shooting of a golden eagle. This bird was shot in France in the year 1845. It had a collar of gold round its neck, and on the collar the inscription was engraved: 'Caucasus patria, Fulgor nomen, Badinski dominus mihi est 1750. (Caucasus my country, Lighting my name, Badinski my master, 1750.)' The inference is that the eagle was used in falconry (as I believe it still is in the Caucasus) and may have been taken from the eyrie and trained for this purpose. But even if the collar had been placed round the bird's neck in the first year of its life, it will would have been ninety-five years old when shot in 1845. It had travelled far from its native land, but there was nothing in the newspaper report to show that it was old or failing in health\"."}]}
