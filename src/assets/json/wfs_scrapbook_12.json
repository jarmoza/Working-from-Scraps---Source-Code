Robertson describes the spinning disc he saw in the air and asserts that he had never before seen photographs of a flying saucer, nor could he have described \"what a flying saucer might look like\". The article reports that neither Renfrew or Prestwick airports were active the day of the sighting, and no comment was provided by controllers from either airport about whether or not they thought the sighting was plausible. The article includes a photograph of Robertson and another man, possibly the reporter who wrote the article. Next to this clipping, Morgan has included two letters from the Evening News's \"You Write\" section. The first is from Mr. Darby, and although Darby says he saw a vapour trail at a different time than Robertson, he confirms that he saw something too. The second letter is from an anonymous writer who signs off as \"Navigator\". This writer states that \"In the relative quiet of the countryside to the east of Glasgow, I watched this object fly around for almost twenty minutes. Beyond any doubt it was a twin jet of the Meteor or Canberra type. It had a decided twin trail and the sound of the jets could be heard\".

The article focuses on an attack by Leonov on Kinsey's book and discusses the ways in which sexual politics and family life are being framed, politicized, and discussed in the Soviet Union. Overall, Leonov sees Kinsey as \"an instrument in the campaign 'to make man into beast, to spread the law of the animal world over human society in order to pervert and falsify the laws of social development, to justify war, to justify the lack of rights and the poverty of the workers, to justify the law of 'might is right''\".

Clippings that appear to be unrelated to hands on this page include a small animal resisting being pulled by leash, a black and white photograph of a group of young men standing outside in school uniform, some of whom appear to be taking photographs, an original black and white photograph of a shirtless man in a sailor hat and white trousers with his arms crossed so that his hands are not visible, and a small colour photograph of an Asian doll's head."}, {"people_ids": ["1", "491", "491", "492", "492", "493", "493", "494", "494", "495", "496", "436", "268", "502"], "sources_ids": ["256", "256", "256", "256", "256", "256", "256", "256", "256", "320", "321", "678", "679"], "people_roles": {"1": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "436": ["Depicted in clipping"], "494": ["Depicted in clipping", "Named in clipping"], "495": ["Depicted in clipping"], "496": ["Depicted in clipping"], "268": ["Depicted in clipping"], "502": ["Named in clipping"], "491": ["Depicted in clipping", "Named in clipping"], "492": ["Depicted in clipping", "Named in clipping"], "493": ["Depicted in clipping", "Named in clipping"]}, "clippings": 19, "suffix": "", "places_ids": ["432", "38", "42", "433"], "notes": "blue ink doodle", "number": "2423", "orig_material": "Y", "clippings_w_metadata": 7, "book_id": "2", "keywords": ["Dance", "Culture", "Men", "Children", "Male Body", "Postage", "Stamps", "History", "Bat", "Ship", "Boat", "Statue", "Art", "Desert", "Bondage"], "stats": {"people_nationalities": {"Greek": 1, "English": 1, "Soviet": 1, "Chinese": 6, "Scottish": 1}, "continent_counts": {"Europe": 1, "Africa": 1, "Asia": 2}, "people_genders": {"Male": 9, "Female": 1}, "source_dates": {}, "sources_rights_holders": {}, "sources_places": {"China": 2, "UK": 1}, "people_titles": {"poymath, physician, pharmacologist, herbalist, acupuncturist": 1, "Queen, Head of the Commonwealth": 1, "revolutionary, poet, political theorist, founding father of the People's Republic of China": 1, "Dr., Poet Makar": 1, "polymath": 1, "teacher, politician, philosopher": 1, "astronomer, mathematician, engineer, Buddhist monk": 1, "dictator": 1, "Prince, Duke of Edinburgh": 1, "mathematician, astronomer, writer, politician": 1}, "place_counts_dict": {}, "people_dates_lived": {}}, "foldout": "N", "id": "105", "orientations": ["portrait"], "desc": "This page includes two black and white clippings that show reproductions of Chinese stamps, as well as providing background for the figures depicted on each stamp.

Stamps 2 and 3 are clipped from the same envelope and have been stamped with a black 1955 Peking postage mark. Stamp 4 has been clipped from a different envelope, along with two other stamps, one depicting Stalin and Mao in the Kremlin and the other a red stamp depicting the Forbidden City. All three stamps have been marked with a black Peking postage mark from 1955. Morgan has also included a second group of three Chinese postage stamps, one from 25 June 1955 commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Chinese Red Cross, another copy of the red stamp of the Forbidden City, and an orange stamp also showing the Forbidden City. These three stamps are stamped with a 1955 black Peking postage mark. Morgan has also included a United Kingdom six pence postage stamp and a black The Duke of Edinburgh postage mark. Other images on this page include a black and white photograph of a man dressed in a white ribbed sweater standing outside and leaning on his knee in a posed manner, an original black and white photograph of a body of water and buildings along the waterfront on the far shore, a black and white photograph of a bat in mid-flight, three black and white clippings that likely came from the same source and are difficult to make out (may be clipped from an photograph of the ground?), an original photograph of a docked ship, a colour reproduction of a Chinese drawing of Confucius, a black and white photograph of a boy standing in front of Michelangelo's David statue, an original black and white photograph of a shirtless man with his arms raised in front of his face and bound with rope to a pole, a black and white photograph of a man squatting down in front of a piece of material, a black and white, full-length photograph of a man standing with his arms at his sides taken in profile, and a colour photograph of several men outside dancing in a circle in the desert, captioned as \"Sc\u00e8ne de danse magon, au Kalahari.

Morgan has annotated the clipping with Giacometti's name in the upper right corner. Much of the rest of this page is themed around baths and water, with a black and white photograph of two men in a canoe reaching down to a third man who is swimming in the water, a black and white photograph of a crowd of people walking underneath a sign that reads \"Baths\" taken from above, an original black and white photograph of a naked man with a tattoo on his arm posing in the shower, a colour photograph of a spiral seashell, and a black and white photograph of Charlie Chaplin lying in a full bathtub while fully clothed and reading a newspaper. Three text-based clippings carry on this theme. The first is a paragraph which reads \"Much of the woodwork of Longwood House was destroyed by white ants years ago, but the building has been repaired, and as a museum it will contain many things Napoleon used. For example, there is his bath, an antique affair with wooden sides. They told me Napoleon spent hours in it - he used to dictate his memoirs from it.\" The second is a short clipping, which reads \"Trautmann, relaxing in his bath later, said, 'The Queen said to me, 'Well done!', and the Duke of Edinburgh asked me, 'What is the matter with you?''\". The third is three clipped sections from O'Donnell's short story \"'--House,' Near Blythswood Square, Glasgow. The Haunted Bath.\" The clippings recount the ghostly activity around the bath, including sloshing water and the sounds of someone bathing, despite no one being visible. The last of the three sections that Morgan has included from this story reads, \"Then something, he would have given anything to tell what, came out and began to steal towards him\". On the end of this sentence, Morgan has added a colon and then has pasted in two extra lines of text from different sources, the first reading \"Bulorns, Kenacks ad Lizamoo\" and the second reading \"plumb bobs with sheathes, grains of paradise, gate frames for penstocks, oil foggers, or even dehydrated kibble.\" Other clippings on this page include a blue stamp from Egypt showing a crate on a hoist and the national emblem, a red stamp from China showing fireworks, a black and white photograph of a statue's eye, an original photograph of a naked man seated on the ground with someone's hand on his shoulder, four black and white clippings, all likely from the same source, that are decorative in nature and difficult to determine their subject, a black and white photograph of a man standing on a ship next to a sail with his back to the camera, and a black and white photograph captioned as \"Plate 52 (detail from Plate 61). Ratha; projection on south face of Visnu Temple with recessed niche showing Visnu lying on the World Serpent 'Endless'. Deogarh, U.P., c. A.D. 500.\""}]}
