This is quite an elaborate ceremony, the pair circling each other in the water, swimming gracefully around and around.

They remain in the pouch for about forty-five days. Lower right is a male with a pouch swollen by prospective small seahorses. One can almost imagine an unhappy look on the paternal face. Above, on this page, the male fish bumps his distended pouch on a shell, possibly with a desire to hasten the day of the ejection of the little ones. Below, through the X-ray, we see the exterior and interior skeleton of the seahorse and the shadowy pouch, and, finally, a tiny new seahorse wriggling out of its father's pouch.

The cuticle consists of great numbers of minute, structureless, transparent, imbricated scales, the apices pointing toward the tip of the hair; the overlapping of the scales reminds one of shingles on a roof or of scales on the body of a fish. As shown by the numerous studies of Professor L. A. Hausman, the size, pattern, and sculpturing of these scales is specific, identification of the species being generally possible from their inspection. This work has played an important role in detection of spurious fur garments. Bat hair is the most interesting of all types for its complex scales and has long been a favorite with the microscopist.\" The clipping continues, discussing the characteristics of various parts of a hair, including pigment in coloured hairs.

Secondly, there is the inexpressible confirmation of meaning. Meaning is assured. Nothing can any longer be meaningless. The question about the meaning of life is no longer there. But were it there, it would not have to be answered. You do not know how to exhibit and define the meaning of life, you have no formula or picture for it, and yet it has more certitude for you than the perceptions of your senses. What does the revealed and concealed meaning purpose with us, desire with us? It does not wish to be explained (nor are we able to do that) but only to be done by us. Thirdly, this meaning is not that of 'another life', but that of this life of ours, not one of a world 'yonder' but that of this world of ours, and it desires its confirmation in this life and in relation with this world. This meaning can be received, but not experienced; it cannot be experienced but it can be done, and this is its purpose with us\". A second text-based clipping on this page is titled \"The Price of Hornlessness\", written by John Hammond, D.Sc., F.R.S.. It states that \"The craze for selecting hornless goats has increased the percentage of intersexual or hermaphrodite animals which have usually the external appearance of a female, but in which the internal reproductive organs have been changed over in varying degrees to the male side, so that they are incapable of breeding\". The clipping cites research by S. A. Asdell, in which three hundred intersexed animals were examined, all of which were hornless. Asdell argues that the goats started as female, but were modified in development by \"a [recessive] gene, or chemical hereditable matter, which causes hornlessness\".

I think you can take it that the practice is now practically unknown. What I was in France before the War - taking a party of cider makers round the wine districts - we were asked to sample the wines from two vats, one of which contained a wine of greatly superior quality to the other. On asking the purpose of this test, we were told that in the better vat of wine they had discovered the skeleton of a baby and it was surmised that in some way this was connected with the improvement in flavour.' *\".

Another text-based clipping on the page appears on blueish-gray paper, with the subtitle \"The first performance of the Shostakovitch 129th in F in London last night was marred by four fatalities, to which reference is made elsewhere. It remains for the critic to say that they luckily had no effect on the performance of the work, which showed the East Grinstead at its versatile best\". The clipping continues, stating that \"The dead of the Bruno Xlavski is a serious loss to music. Those of us who have watched his meteoric rise since he first discarded the triangle will feel an irreparable blow. It is a fitting comment on his genius to say that he piloted the Shostakovitch 129th masterfully, to his end. The last three hours of the work showed how brilliantly the orchestra can rise to an emergency. Other sections from the clipping read \"Music has also lost by the death of Smith, the Croat whose work as a sound effectist has been noticeable in a number of modern orchestras. He was particularly effective on the air raid siren.\" Referring to the new symphony, the clipping states that \"The composer - who saw in, by the way, from Leningrad, as he abominates the English spring and would not travel - has used his whole battery of technical resource. Twelve drummers and eight sound effects men made up a massive wall of orchestral sound, through which the 32 first violins succeeded in occasionally interpolating a line of pure if reluctant melody. The symphony is divided into 28 movements of which the last six are the longest. There are thematic associations between alternate third movements, with repercussions in the undertones. There is thus a haunting effect as of an idea being systematically followed by a diminishing echo, and the critical appreciation needs tuning up to it\". The clipping concludes under the subtitle \"Gas Jet Hiss\", and reads \"All this will need sorting out by the various Shostakovitch societies all over the world.[sic] most of whom, we think, will find it hard to accept the master's early introduction of the idea of an escaping gas jet - a noise produced by the sound effectists with the utmost stealth. It was hissed by the audience. It plays a valuable part, however, in the overtones of the dominant introductory theme, and he would be a brave man indeed who would find fault.

A woman and her two daughters, convicted of larceny, were taken to Maen Escop (the old Cornish name for Bishop's Rock, the well-known Atlantic lighthouse and the most westerly point of England) with two barley loaves and a pitcher of water, and there left to be drowned by the waves of the sea.

The man appears to be wearing a wig that has been tied back in a ponytail, and he is wearing a cravat and a buttoned up jacket. The article discusses organizations of beggars in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century London, in which there were different roles and types of beggars. The article names the men's roles as the Upright Man, who is the chief, the Ruffler, who is the Upright Man's second, Anglers, who fished through windows for sheets, Fraters, who were bogus hospital collectors, Priggers and Prancers, who stole horses, Counterfeit Cranks, who were fake epileptics, The Drummer, who doubled his tongue to make noise instead of speech, Tom of Bedlam or Abraham Man, who pretended to be mad, Jackman, who forged licenses to beg, and the Glymmer, who carried a license that said his house had been burnt down. Women to whom the Upright Man exercised \"some sort of seigniorial claim\" are said to have various names, with Dells denoting virgins, Doxies denoting those who were not virgins, but are unmarried, Antem Morts denoting those who married, and Walking Morts denoting those who were unmarried but had children. The children of Walking Morts were called Lullaby-Cheats. Thieving roles for women are listed as Bawdy-Baskets, \"who peddled haberdashery from house to house, bought coneyskins, and stole what they could\", Kinchin Morts, who carried young babies and pricked them to make them cry in order to collect alms, while it is said that both men and women could specialize in clymes, or fake sores. The article states that \"In the year 1600 there were supposed to be 12,000 beggars in London alone\" and described the \"suburbs of London, the 'dark dennes'\" as the \"worst places in England for beggars\". The clipping concludes by stating that \"in the seventeenth century the beggar bands were broken up. Rogues were hauled in, branded with an R, and sent to Virginia. It was no longer safe to move in bands, the day of the individual had returned. Some of the ex-members became highwaymen, some Coney Catchers, or confidencemen. There were various forms of this. The Courtesy Man persuaded people to play cards with strangers: the Foist held his victim in charming conversation while removing his purse. He had to possess 'an eagle's eye, a lady's hand, and a lion's heart.' The Nip cut purses and let the coins drop into his hand. There were academies for Nips, where the little lads practised on figures hung with bells\"."}, {"people_ids": ["797", "846", "844", "845"], "sources_ids": ["816", "817", "818", "819"], "people_roles": {"797": ["Depicted in clipping"], "846": ["Depicted in clipping"], "845": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "844": ["Illustrator/Artist"]}, "clippings": 13, "suffix": "", "places_ids": ["707", "708"], "notes": "", "number": "826", "orig_material": "N", "clippings_w_metadata": 3, "book_id": "4", "keywords": ["Engraving", "Carving", "Sculpture", "Painting", "Flowers", "Vase", "Pottery", "Church", "Religion", "Sheep", "Spider", "Castle", "Bird", "Frog", "Animals", "Great Hairy Willow-Herb", "Common Fumitory", "Ostrich", "Boat", "Water", "Landscape", "Cow", "River", "Red-Figure", "Art", "Men", "Cigarette Card"], "stats": {"people_nationalities": {"German": 1, "Greek": 1}, "continent_counts": {"Europe": 2}, "people_genders": {"Male": 4}, "source_dates": {}, "sources_rights_holders": {"St Mary's Museum": 2, "Rijksmuseum": 1, "Louvre": 1}, "sources_places": {}, "people_titles": {"painter, engraver, architect": 1, "prophet": 1, "Saint, Apostle": 1, "painter": 1}, "place_counts_dict": {}, "people_dates_lived": {}}, "foldout": "N", "id": "188", "orientations": ["portrait"], "desc": "This page includes a black and white reproduction of the red-figure images from side A of The Niobid krater, a black and white clipping containing two photographs of statues, one captioned as \"Fig. 111.

The clippings state that \"It was not uncommon for Gypsy women, especially if they were elderly, to be buried alive. But death by hanging, even death by live burial, it was realised by the Germans, was altogether too quick and painless. By a Frankfort-on-Maine decree of 1722, it was enacted that all Gypsies were to leave the Upper Rhine area (as similar decrees were already in force throughout the German states, these people had nowhere to go), that all Gypsies found in the area after a short time were to be branded with the letters O.C., and then to be scourged, both punishments to be inflicted in public. If after this they were found again, they were to be executed either by hanging or by beheading. But if any crime other than that of being a Gypsy could be brought against them, they were first to be pinched with red-hot tongs and then broken alive on the wheel. No distinction was made between the sexes so far as these punishments were concerned, save that it was recommended that the women be more severely dealt with. A Neuburg decree of 1766 ordered that all Gypsies were to be arrested and tortured. They were, if no crime could be brought against them, to be beaten with rods and branded upon the back with a gallows, male and female alike; if a crime could be proved against them, they were to be executed. Branded Gypsies, if arrested, were to be hanged without further trial in the public street. The Neuburg decree also provided for the punishment of gorgios found associating with or helping the Gypsies. Between the years of 1700 and 1800, no fewer than 76 decrees of this sort were passed in Germany. It is not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that we find any sort of protest against these barbarities being made by a German. Then we do find one writer going to great lengths to justify them, while another admits he cannot think without discomfort of an 'old, helpless, perhaps quite innocent' Gypsy woman who had been buried alive\"."}, {"people_ids": ["881", "882", "28"], "sources_ids": ["863", "864", "865"], "people_roles": {"882": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "881": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "28": ["Depicted in clipping"]}, "clippings": 8, "suffix": "", "places_ids": ["99", "726"], "notes": "", "number": "838", "orig_material": "N", "clippings_w_metadata": 3, "book_id": "4", "keywords": ["Sports", "Ninepin", "Women", "Men", "Sheep", "Fish", "Grey Gurnard", "Lump Sucker", "Caterpillar", "Luna Moth Caterpillar", "Religion", "Book", "Illuminated Manuscript", "Wood", "Landscape", "Trees", "Painting", "Drawing", "Engraving", "Carving", "Animals", "Nature", "Cigarette Card"], "stats": {"people_nationalities": {"Galilean Jewish": 1, "English": 1, "Dutch": 1}, "continent_counts": {"Europe": 2}, "people_genders": {"Male": 3}, "source_dates": {}, "sources_rights_holders": {"Trinity College Library": 1}, "sources_places": {}, "people_titles": {"painter": 1, "engraver, natural historian": 1}, "place_counts_dict": {}, "people_dates_lived": {}}, "foldout": "N", "id": "200", "orientations": ["portrait"], "desc": "This page includes a colour reproduction of De Hooch's painting A Game of Ninepins, a black and white photograph of a Luna Moth Caterpillar on a leaf, a black and white engraving of a fish, captioned as \"Lump Sucker: Cyclopterus Lumpus Drawn and engraved by Bewick\", a black and white photograph of a detail from a relief carving, which overlaps slightly on the Lump Sucker clipping and shows a man sitting with several sheep outside of a castle wall, a colour painting of a fish, likely from a cigarette card, captioned as \"Grey Gurnard\", a black and white reproduction of a painting showing a rural village and two people in the foreground and hills in the background, a black and white photograph of a weathered piece of wood, possibly a mooring post on a dock, and a black and white reproduction of a detail from the Book of Kells, captioned as \"Christ between two Romans.

Our visit was a blessing to us and we have reason to believe that it was also a blessing to Miss Brown and Miss Robel, the two brave girls stationed here. Six or eight Indians showed a desire to follow the Lord and we prayed with them. Some of them had made previous beginnings but had been pulled down by sin. Indian work needs a great deal of prayer. 'Yesterday I saw the Minister of War again and made arrangements to demonstrate to-day. The Minister, two generals, the head of the Police of Quito and a number of officers and soldiers were present. I used the 'Billy' first but I am sorry to say it did not prove a success. I shot it at two soldiers but they were able to stand the gas and get me. I then shot the grenade in a room and asked the men to go in. This was a real success and helped to gain what I had lost through the failure of the 'Billy'. 'Colonel Santor happened to be here on a visit and he witnessed the demonstration. I found out through his conversation with the Minister that he, it seemed, secured some gas grenades (larger than yours and black) through the American brewer, Yoder. This is no doubt the reason he has been putting me off. It is more than likely that he got something out of it. 'Before leaving, the Minister asked me to give him the best price on 100 'Billies' and 200 grenades. I told him I would write to you and have you send him quotations and terms direct . . . . 'I have a letter from the Reed boys telling me that they are getting in touch with you. It may be best to have them as your agents from now on but I don't think they should come in for any of this order, as I . . .'
