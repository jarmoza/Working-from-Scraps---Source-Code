For this failure to act, the heir suffers a sibyl's curse. Another clipping, titled \"King Oswald's Arm (Bamborough, Yorkshire)\", describes King Oswald's generosity to beggars at an Easter feast, and a subsequent blessing prayed on the \"arm which performed the deed\" by Bishop Aidan.

It is now tame, and when on view soon draws a crowd.\" This page also includes four Brittanica clippings. \"The Devil's Arrows (Aldborough, Yorkshire)\" tells of a debate between Christian and Druid beliefs in which a devil disguised himself and began to sway favour away from the Christian until it was seen that his feet were melting the rock he stood on. \"The White Hare (Cornwall)\" discusses the belief that broken-hearted maidens reappear after death as white hares. \"The Glastonbury Thorn (Glastonbury, Somerset)\" describes the great fecundity of a tree that grew from Joseph of Arimathea's hawthorn staff. \"The Dancers of Stanton Drew (Somerset)\" tells of a bride who refused to stop dancing on her wedding night, even when warned that the party had extended into the Lord's Day. A fiddler arrived who played through the night, but soon the party found they could not stop dancing. In the morning, the revelers were gone and groups of stones were in their place.

One of these shows that Peace combines the character for Roof and Woman, under which Morgan has written \"Soloman!\". Another clipping describes supplies for a large feast, including \"500 pints of clear mock turtle soup\", \"230 roast chickens\" and \"12 dozen bottles of beer, and red and white wine\". Another clipping says that 76-year-old John Frederick Cotty was found \"unfit to plead to a charge of murdering his wife, Amy Blanche Cotty (78)\" and so was detained \"during His Majesty's pleasure\".

Also included is a text excerpt that reads \"lives in Campden Hill, within a stone's throw of Charles Morgan, but says 'I've never thrown a stone at him.'\" Below the large clipping is a handwritten text excerpt that is not written in modern English (possibly Old English), a line from a letter to T.W from Donne, reading \"My verse, the strict Map of my misery\", and lines from Davies' short story \"The Wages of Love\", reading \"The rusty mountains wept, the bobbing chrysanthemums in the back-gardens were running with liquid coal-dust. A wind whipped through the dirty valey and rubbed stingingly at her silken legs\". To the left of the large clipping is a line of verse from the anonymous poem \"The Seven Virgins: A Carol\", which reads \"Oh the rose, the rose, the gentle rose,/ And the fennel that grows so green!\"."}, {"people_ids": ["77", "1", "87", "88", "89", "90", "92", "96", "828"], "sources_ids": ["41", "42", "43", "44", "45", "46", "48", "10", "419", "420", "421", "758"], "people_roles": {"1": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "77": ["Author/Writer"], "88": ["Author/Writer"], "89": ["Author/Writer"], "828": ["Author/Writer"], "90": ["Author/Writer"], "92": ["Author/Writer"], "87": ["Author/Writer"], "96": ["Illustrator/Artist"]}, "clippings": 15, "suffix": "", "places_ids": ["3", "86", "87", "129", "242"], "notes": "small pink ink doodle", "number": "236", "orig_material": "Y", "clippings_w_metadata": 9, "book_id": "1", "keywords": ["Nature", "Art", "Poetry", "Rabbit", "Hare", "Crab", "Insects", "Beetles", "Love", "Morals", "Damnation", "Eternity", "Animals", "Drawing", "Collage", "Hell", "Old English", "Russian Language", "Philosophy", "Moon", "Lily", "Germander", "Sweet Briar", "Strawberry", "Flowers"], "stats": {"people_nationalities": {"German": 2, "Scottish": 2, "Roman": 1, "Welsh": 1, "American": 1, "English": 2}, "continent_counts": {"Europe": 3, "Imaginary": 1, "Not Applicable (refers to planet or other celestial body bigger than a continent)": 1}, "people_genders": {"Male": 8, "Female": 1}, "source_dates": {}, "sources_rights_holders": {"Odhams Press Ltd.": 1}, "sources_places": {"London, UK": 1}, "people_titles": {"artist": 1, "writer": 2, "Dr., Poet Makar": 1, "poet, cleric, Church of England": 1, "poet": 1, "advisor to Constantine I, writer": 1, "screenwriter, writer, director, actress": 1, "poet, physician": 1}, "place_counts_dict": {}, "people_dates_lived": {}}, "foldout": "N", "id": "23", "orientations": ["mixed"], "desc": "The center of the page is taken up by an illustrated clipping that focuses on the art of Albrecht D\u00fcrer from Zoo magazine's \"Animals in Art\" series.

He has drawn a similarly sized triangle in pink ink on the other side of the larger clipping's title as well.  Variously pasted around the larger clipping are three images: a black and white photograph of a decorative vase, a small black and white photograph of a carved hooded figure, and a black and white photograph of a ceramic male figure.

On the back of the fold, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph captioned as the \"Old Age Pensions Institute in Prague, by Havlicke and Honzik, 1934\", as well as an article from the Bulletin bearing a subtitle of \"Fingers Burned\", which describes a demonstration in Venice by Professor R.W. Wood. The demonstration showed a slab of quartz being subjected to \"an oscillating current of 280,000 periods a second and 50,000 volts tension\" in a bowl of oil. A glass of water containing a live fish was then placed in the oil, causing the fish to die. The demonstration also showed hands being burned by touching glass that had been placed in the oil, despite the glass not being heated. The article closes by saying it is unclear in the fish experiment whether \"it is that ultra-sonic waves heat the body to such an extent as to cause death, or whether death is determined by the liberation of the gases forming part of the blood\". Along the top of the page, an Old English paragraph has been clipped, as has a newspaper photograph from the Bulletin showing a sandstone slab with hieroglyphics and captioned as \"This sandstone slab, measuring three feet in length, with raised hieroglyphics, has been discovered on the farm of Garth, Harray, Orkney\".

This page also includes two short articles. The first is from the Evening News and reports Professor Jansky's claims that he has \"received short-wave radio signals which originate from some station beyond the earth\", the basis for which claim he cites as the fact that the signals \"take three to fifteen seconds to reach his receiver,\" fixing \"the place of their origin at a spot many millions of miles from the earth\". Jansky says that he will \"construct the most powerful shortwave receiver in the world, so that he can study these signals more closely,\" and reminds cynics that extraterrestrial communication is possible, given that \"our more powerful military short-wave transmitters send signals that could be received in the moon if anyone happened to be there\". The second article is from the Bulletin and is titled \"Chilled Himself Into Insanity: Land of Errors\". It describes Sir Joseph Barcroft's efforts to explore the \"borderland of insanity by chilling his body to the early stages of freezing\" in order to \"pass beyond the 'censorship of the mind'. He says he chilled himself to the degree that \"nerve censorship\" let go, and he found that \"he had no natural apprehension lest some person alien to the experiment should enter the room and find him unclad\".

It also discusses a carver named Bamgboye, who is said to be \"one of the best of the surviving Yoruba carvers\". Next to this clipping is a black and white photograph of a carving, captioned as \"A dignified iroko carving representing the head of a Yoruba woman\", to which Morgan has added a note reading \"by Bamgboye\". Around the carving clipping, Morgan has drawn small ink doodles that resemble seaweed and bubbles. Other clippings include two colour images of cartoonish characters, a black and white photograph of a porcelain man holding a cup in one hand and a pitcher in another, a black and white photograph of a frieze showing many figures, and four lines from Racine's Ph\u00e8dre, reading \"Il a vu le Cocyte et les rivages sombres,/ Et s'est montr\u00e9 vivant aux infernales ombres;/ Mais qu'il n'a pu sortir de ce triste s\u00e8jour,/ Et repasser les bords qu'on passe sans retour\". In the center of the page is a colour drawing of a fish, likely from a cigarette card, captioned as a \"Greater Weever-Fish\", as well as a large clipping that shows three black and white photographs of a wall-plaque by Bamgboye. The first image shows the entire wall plaque, and is captioned as being \"carved on a mahogany plank about four feet long. The scenes from right to left represent the birth, life and death of a hunter. Two of the panels are illustrated on a larger scale below\". The second photograph shows the center panel, which is captioned as \"Enjoying life: the village chief wearing necklaces and holding fly whisk with musicians and friends\", and the third photograph shows the left panel, described as \"Death: the wives are mourning and friends are firing dane guns.

The article states that many \"old graves when opened are found to contain tiny glass or earthenware vessels known as tear-bottles\", which would have been filled with mourners' tears and \"laid beside the corpse as 'soul-substance'\". The article includes a drawing of two tear-bottles, underneath which is quoted Psalms 56-8: \"Put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?\" Next to this clipping, Morgan has pasted a clipping of a short description of two men, McDonald and McKinnan, who killed the last Auk to be seen in Britain.

The heads are hollow and each has a circular hole about 3 ins. in diameter at the back of the skull\". On this clipping, Morgan has written \"see 1499\", referring to another scrapbook page. Below this clipping is a larger photograph of the head labelled C. The head is shown in profile and the photograph is captioned as \"Side view of head (C). The small holes in the face penetrate to the interior. The bronze is about 1/4 in. thick\". Onto this clipping, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of cylindrical stones that looks like it might be from the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, as well as a black and white photograph of a man in uniform holding up a large sheet and a black and white image of something that is difficult to make out, but might be a stone carving. Morgan has also added pink ink lines and doodles around the two extra clippings collaged onto the page. Next to the photograph of head (C), Morgan has included a second photograph, this one straight on and close up, of head (B). Around these 3 larger clippings Morgan has included lines from Dunbar's \"Lament for the Makers\", reading \"Our pleasance here is all vain glory,/ This false world is but transitory,/ The flesh is bruckle, the Fiend is slee;/ Timor mortis conturbat me\", a coloured cartoonish drawing of what might be a side view of a mask and four coloured dots, a black and white photograph of a carved stone frieze, a black and white full-body profile photograph of a man dressed in Roman costume, a black and white ceramic or porcelain male figure holding a mug, a colour drawing, likely from a cigarette card, showing three prawns, one red, one green and one blue, with the caption \"The Aesop Prawn\", and an illustration from \"Ommie Wise\", an American murder ballad, showing the murder of Ommie (or Naomi Wise) at the hands of her lover, John Lewis. Also included are two short articles. The first states that \"Cosmic rays destroy on Earth about one atom per cubic centimeter per second\", thus attesting to life's \"incredible persistence\" and \"ability to adapt itself to [the] unbelievable rigors\" of Earth. The article emphasizes the importance of procreation to the continuance of life, and states that \"Our atmosphere is a futile shield against the terrific power of cosmic particles. Only the invisible, intangible defenses of the Sun's vast magnetic field, and Earth's lesser one protect us, make it possible for human beings to have human children, and not give birth to monstrous, unnamable things\". The second article is from Picture Post and discusses a \"telescope with a lens 100 inches wide\" which has been used to photograph Jupiter. These photographs have enabled the discovery of two new moons, bringing the known total to 11. The article then states that when Galileo first posited that Jupiter had four moons, \"Certain important Cardinals had no difficulty in proving that Galileo must be wrong. A dignitary named Sizzi roundly said, 'The moons are invisible to the naked eye, and therefore can have no influence on the earth, and therefore would be useless, and therefore do not exist!'\".

Comfort thyself, said the king, and do as well as thou mayest, for in me is no trust for to trust in; for I will into the vale of Avilion to heal me of my grievous wound: and if thou hear never more of me, pray for my soul.

To the loss of that,/ Sufficient penaltie, why has thou added/ The sense of endless woes? Inexplicable/ Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, I thus contest\".

The captions name N.E. Congo, Cameroons, Equator, North Kenya, Congo, and the Motuan tribe of Papua. The women, however, are not named. The outside edge of this clipping has been folded to make it fit into the scrapbook. On the back of the fold, Morgan has pasted four black and white images: a photograph of a tree in what looks to be spring, an aerial photograph that seems to depict a rift in the earth, a photograph of several small fish swimming amongst greenery, and a microscope photograph of trypanosomes in a blood smear, captioned as \"Trypanosomes de la maladie du sommeil, dans un frottis de sang.

She and Princess Elizabeth did a tap dance\". Below the large clipping, Morgan has included a colour photograph of a beetle that looks strikingly like a green leaf, and a colour drawing of a Dragonet flying fish from a cigarette card, with the caption \"Player's Cigarettes\" and \"Dragonet\" printed on the clipping. To the right of this clipping, Morgan has drawn small bubbles in blue ink and to the left of the image, he has drawn a small, cartoonish Dragonet in pink ink."}, {"people_ids": ["274", "275"], "sources_ids": ["228"], "people_roles": {"274": ["Depicted in clipping"], "275": ["Illustrator/Artist"]}, "clippings": 6, "suffix": "", "places_ids": [], "notes": "", "number": "263", "orig_material": "N", "clippings_w_metadata": 1, "book_id": "1", "keywords": ["Art", "Men", "Dog", "Baby", "Crocodile", "Crocodile Tears", "Squid", "Nature", "Fish", "Deer", "Sea", "Painting", "Carving"], "stats": {"people_nationalities": {"German": 2}, "continent_counts": {}, "people_genders": {"Male": 2}, "source_dates": {}, "sources_rights_holders": {}, "sources_places": {}, "people_titles": {"Hanse merchant": 1, "artist": 1}, "place_counts_dict": {}, "people_dates_lived": {}}, "foldout": "N", "id": "50", "orientations": ["portrait"], "desc": "A large colour reproduction of Holbein's \"Der Kaufmann George Gisze\" (or \"The Merchant Georg Gisze\") takes up much of this page.

The clipping describes a 22-year-old girl who was born blind but recovered her sight. The article describes how difficult things like walking up stairs and judging distances became for her, as well as her disappointment in the look of some things, such as animals in the zoo (which she thought would be bigger) and human faces (which she said had less happy expressions that she had expected and which she had difficulty in distinguishing from one another at first). Above and below this clipping Morgan has included small black and white images. The top image is a black and white photograph that appears to show light reflecting on water and the bottom image is difficult to make out, but may also be depicting water. The page also contains a black and white photograph of two stone figures that appear to be sitting together in a vessel, a black and white photograph of a male sculpture standing with his arms extended out to the side and raised at his elbows, a black and white photograph of a carved head, possibly a mask, and a clipping with two black and white photographs of stone relief sculptures, one a detailed dragon's head and one that appears to depict a mermaid, jointly captioned as \"Examples of Makara and Khmer sculpture recently excavated and now included among the pieces for exhibition in the new galleries of the Mus\u00e9e Guinet, Paris\". Morgan has also included the first several lines from the poem \"Song to the Wind\", which appears in the Book of Teliesin, reading \"Discover thou what is/ The strong creature from before the flood,/ Without flesh, without bone,/ Without vein, without blood,/ Without head, without feet,/ It will neither be older nor younger/ Than at the beginning;/ For fear of a denial,/ There are no rude wants/ With creatures./ Great God! how the sea whitens/ When first it comes!/ Great are its gusts/ When it comes from the south;/ Great are its evaporations/ When it strikes on coasts./ It is in the field, it is in the wood,/ Without hand, and without foot,/ Without signs of old age,/ Though it be co-aeval/ With the five ages or periods\". Morgan has decorated the page with blue and pink ink doodles."}]}
